### How to Use
1. **Reference by number** when making commits, PRs, or comments (e.g. “Fixes #46: update AJAX URL”).
2. **Move each issue** through your board columns—Backlog → Ready → In Progress → Testing → Done.
3. **Update this list** as new issues are created (add at the appropriate section), or as statuses change (move to “Completed” when closed).

Feel free to reorder or re-categorize this list as your workflow demands. Keeping `ISSUES.md` in your repo root will help everyone stay aware of what’s pending, in progress, or finished.
