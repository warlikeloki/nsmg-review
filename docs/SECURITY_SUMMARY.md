# Security Improvements Summary

## What Was Done

Your contact forms now have comprehensive protection against spam and malicious attacks. Here's what was implemented:

### ‚úÖ Immediate Protection (Active Now)

1. **CSRF Protection** - Prevents form hijacking attacks
2. **Rate Limiting** - Maximum 3 submissions per 5 minutes per session
3. **Advanced Spam Detection** - Automatically blocks common spam patterns
4. **Input Sanitization** - Cleans all user input
5. **Malicious Input Detection** - Blocks XSS and injection attempts
6. **Security Headers** - Protects against clickjacking and other attacks
7. **Environment Variables** - Credentials moved to `.env` file (not in git)

### üîß Ready for Future Use

8. **Geographic Restriction** - Code ready to limit access to North America when needed

## Quick Start

### For You (Site Owner)

**No action required!** Everything is working immediately. Your forms are now protected.

### Optional: Review Spam Logs

If you enabled logging in `.env`:
```bash
# Check for spam attempts
tail -f logs/mail.log
```

### Optional: Enable Geographic Restrictions

When ready to block non-North America traffic:

1. Open [php/security.php](../php/security.php)
2. Find the `GeoRestriction` class
3. Uncomment the `checkIPViaAPI()` method
4. Add to form handlers:
```php
$geoCheck = GeoRestriction::checkIPViaAPI($_SERVER['REMOTE_ADDR']);
if (!$geoCheck['allowed']) {
  json_fail('Service not available in your region.', 403);
}
```

## What Changed

### New Files
- `php/security.php` - All security features
- `php/get_csrf_token.php` - Provides security tokens
- `.env` - Your credentials (safe, not in git)
- `.env.example` - Template for credentials
- `docs/FORM_SECURITY.md` - Full documentation

### Updated Files
- `php/submit_contact.php` - Added all protections
- `php/submit_service_request.php` - Added all protections
- `php/mail_config.php` - Now loads from .env
- `js/modules/contact.js` - Handles security tokens
- `js/modules/service-request.js` - Handles security tokens

## Current Protection Levels

| Threat | Protection Level | Method |
|--------|------------------|--------|
| Basic bots | ‚úÖ‚úÖ‚úÖ High | Honeypot field |
| Advanced bots | ‚úÖ‚úÖ‚úÖ High | CSRF + Rate limiting |
| Spam floods | ‚úÖ‚úÖ‚úÖ High | Rate limiting (3/5min) |
| Spam keywords | ‚úÖ‚úÖ‚úÖ High | Pattern detection |
| XSS attacks | ‚úÖ‚úÖ‚úÖ High | Input validation |
| CSRF attacks | ‚úÖ‚úÖ‚úÖ High | Token validation |
| Clickjacking | ‚úÖ‚úÖ Medium | Security headers |
| Foreign spam | ‚úÖ Low (ready) | Geo-blocking (disabled) |

## Testing Recommendations

### 1. Normal Operation Test
- Submit a legitimate contact form
- Should work instantly
- You should receive the email

### 2. Rate Limit Test
- Submit contact form 3 times quickly
- 4th submission should be blocked
- Wait 5 minutes, should work again

### 3. Spam Test (Optional)
- Try submitting with obvious spam text
- Form will appear to succeed but no email sent
- Check logs to confirm spam detection

## Adjusting Settings

### Make Rate Limiting Less Strict

Edit `php/submit_contact.php` line 47:
```php
// Change from 3 per 5 minutes to 5 per 10 minutes
$rateLimit = new RateLimit('contact_form', 5, 600);
```

### Extend CSRF Token Lifetime

Edit `php/security.php` line 12:
```php
// Change from 1 hour to 2 hours
const TOKEN_LIFETIME = 7200;
```

### Add Custom Spam Patterns

Edit `php/security.php` around line 230:
```php
$spamPatterns = [
  // Add your own patterns here
  '/\byour-spam-word\b/i',
];
```

## Important Security Notes

### ‚úÖ DO
- Review spam logs regularly
- Keep `.env` file secure (it's in .gitignore)
- Update spam patterns as needed
- Test forms after any changes

### ‚ùå DON'T
- Don't commit `.env` file to git (already protected)
- Don't share the `.env` file
- Don't disable security features without understanding impact
- Don't make rate limits too permissive

## Need More Protection?

If spam continues to be a problem, consider:

1. **Google reCAPTCHA v3** (invisible, very effective)
   - See [docs/FORM_SECURITY.md](FORM_SECURITY.md#adding-recaptcha-optional-future-enhancement)

2. **Geographic Restrictions** (block non-North America)
   - See [docs/FORM_SECURITY.md](FORM_SECURITY.md#9-geographic-restriction-ready-for-future-use)

3. **IP-based Rate Limiting** (more persistent)
   - See [docs/FORM_SECURITY.md](FORM_SECURITY.md#upgrading-rate-limiting)

## Support

- **Full Documentation**: [docs/FORM_SECURITY.md](FORM_SECURITY.md)
- **Code Comments**: All security code is well-commented
- **Testing Guide**: See FORM_SECURITY.md "Testing" section
