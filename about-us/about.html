          <img src="/media/team/neil-smith.jpg" alt="Neil Smith" class="team-photo" decoding="async" loading="lazy" />
          <h3>Neil Smith</h3>
          <p>Founder, Photographer, Videographer, and Creative Director</p>
          <p> Neil is a multimedia professional with a sharp eye for detail, a passion for visual storytelling, and over a decade of hands-on experience in photography, videography, and post-production. From concept development to final delivery, Neil brings a calm, confident presence to every project — whether it's capturing live events, producing corporate content, or developing creative assets for campaigns and clients. His approach blends technical skill with creative insight, ensuring every frame tells a story and every project exceeds expectations. </p>
          <p> When not behind the camera or editing suite, Neil is often refining his gear setup, consulting on creative strategy, or — let's be honest — indulging his canine intern's unspoken demand for regular breaks and treats. </p>

          <img src="/media/team/intern.jpg" alt="Tallulah the Intern" class="team-photo" decoding="async" loading="lazy" />
          <h3>Tallulah</h3>
          <p>Intern (Unofficial CEO and Cuddling Coordinator)</p>
          <p>
            Tallulah may have "intern" in her title, but don’t let that fool you — she runs a tight ship. Equal parts adorable and authoritative, she supervises every project from the comfort of a sunny spot on the floor. Her favorite tasks include barking during video calls, overseeing snack breaks, and enforcing mandatory petting sessions. As far as she’s concerned, she’s the boss — and honestly, she probably is.
