# Code of Conduct

We follow a simple, respectful code:

- Be welcoming and inclusive. Harassment or discrimination is not tolerated.
- Assume good intent; disagree constructively; focus on the work.
- Keep feedback specific and actionable. No personal attacks.
- Respect privacy; do not share private data from issues or PRs.
- Follow project maintainersâ€™ decisions; propose alternatives politely.

**Enforcement:** Report violations privately to **contact@neilsmith.org**. We may warn, limit participation, or remove individuals from project spaces for violations.
